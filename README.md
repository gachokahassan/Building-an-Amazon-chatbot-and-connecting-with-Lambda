# Building-an-Amazon-chatbot-and-connecting-with-Lambda
This project connects an Amazon Lex chatbot, BankerBot, to an AWS Lambda function for dynamic user interactions. It utilizes intents like "CheckBalance" and "FollowupCheckBalance" to retrieve and display random bank balance figures, enhancing the user experience with an interactive banking interface.
